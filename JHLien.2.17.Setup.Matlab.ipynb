    "2.17)  A wall consists of layers of metals and plastic with heat transfer coefficients on either side.  $U$ is $255 W/m^2K$ and the overall temperature difference is $200 \\;^o C$.  One layer in the wall is stainless steel ($k = 18 \\; W/mK$) $3 \\; mm$ thick.  What is $\\Delta T$ across the stainless steel?\n",
