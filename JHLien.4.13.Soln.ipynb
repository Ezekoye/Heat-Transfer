    "4.13)  What is the minimum length, $L$, of a thermometer well necessary to ensure an error less than $0.5 \\%$ of the difference between the pipe wall temperature and the temperature of fluid flowing in a pipe?  The well consists of a tube reaching into the pipe, with its end closed. It has a $2 \\;cm$ O.D. and a $1.88 \\;cm$  I.D.  The material is type 304 stainless steel.  Assume that the fluid is steam at $260^o \\; C$ and that the heat transfer coefficient between the steam and tube wall is $300 \\; W/m^2K$.\n",

    "Setup:  A thermometer well is a sleeve within which a thermometer is placed to protect it from the outside environment.  This particular well is a hollow stainless steel tube.  As you know, conduction losses will cause the tip of the thermometer well (where the sensing element touches the well) to be different from the fluid temperature.  How long must the well be so that we have a $0.5 \\%$ error.  Just use the adiabatic tip solution.  Note that the cross-sectional area is for a hollow cylinder.\n",
